Github commands: 

Before starting any new work - make sure you have pushed your previous changes before this 

'git pull' to check if any changes have been made to master (the code on github)

To push code to github, enter the following commands: (move to the next step only if the previous one was successful)

git status (this shows you which files you have changed, good to check in case you accidentally changed something - 
these are listed in red because they are unstaged i.e. not in the list of files to be committed)
git add . (adds all of your changed files to the files which will be committed (stages them), you can also enter just specific file names here 
if you want but we'll probably only want to commit all files each time)
git status (files should now be listed in green because they are staged)
git commit -m 'some message about your changes'
git push

Let everyone else know you've pushed something!
